# simple-backup-tool
This is a simple backup tool for backing up files on a Linux/Unix/FreeBSD system

This script was written for FreeBSD and ZFS, so if you intend to use this for other systems, either modify it for your own use, or if you want to 
share your changes, do so in a way that doesn't break usage for FreeBSD and ZFS.
